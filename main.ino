void setup() {
  // This function runs once when the Arduino board is powered on or reset.
  // It is used to initialize variables, pin modes, libraries, etc.
}

  // This function runs repeatedly after the setup() function has finished.
  // It is used to implement the main logic of your Arduino program.
